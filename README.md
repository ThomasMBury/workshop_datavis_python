## Summary				
Modern scientific methods give rise to vast quantities of data. Creating effective visualisations is essential for both presentation and exploration of the data. This is no easy task when the data contains dozens of variables and millions of entries. Traditional visualisations are static, that is, what the user sees is what the user gets. Interactive visualisations allow the user to perform tasks such as varying parameters, honing in subsections of the data, and switching between different plot types, all without touching the code! This faciliates rapid exploration of the data. Moreover, these visulisations can be easily shared with collaborators who only require a web browser to open the visualisation.	

This workshop will equip participants with the skills required to begin creating interactive visualisations in Python. The format will be interactive, with alternation between demonstrations by the instructor and participants working through their own Jupyter notebook (provided in advance). Participants will come away having made several of their own visualisations of either a large public dataset, or their own dataset if they would like to bring one. See this  [interactive visualisation](https://ecg-dashboard-medium.herokuapp.com/) of ECG data from Physionet for an example of what can be achieved with these tools.

## Objectives		
In this workshop, we will use the *pandas* library to manipulate dataframes, the *plotly* library to make interactive visualisations and the *dash* library to bring together the visualisations into a dashboard. Participants of the workshop will learn and implement the following techniques:
- Organisation of *pandas* DataFrames to facilitate rapid plotting.
- Use of basic Plotly functionality including the creation of different plot representations (Bar, Line, Scatter, Histogram) and exportation to html files for interactive viewing.
- Visualisation of higher-dimensional data with the use of multiple traces, grid plots and 3-dimensional plotting.
- Integration of sliders and drop-down boxes to interactively switch between different visualisations of the data.
- (If time allows.) Combining interactive plots into a dashboard with components connected by callback functions.


## Setup instructions

Python 3 and JupyterLab are required for the workshop. If these are already installed on your computer you may skip these steps.
1. Download the Anaconda distribution
